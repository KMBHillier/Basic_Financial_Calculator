# Basic Financial Calculator
This is a simple calculator that calculates the amount of interest you'll earn on your investment or the amount you'll have to pay on a home loan.

To use the calculator, you first need to choose either "investment" or "bond" by typing it in the prompt and press enter.

If you choose "investment", the calculator will ask you for the amount of money you will be depositing, the interest rate, and the number of years you will hold this investment. Then it will ask you if you want simple or compound interest. Depending on your choice, the calculator will show you the final value of your investment after the specified number of years.

If you choose "bond", the calculator will ask you for the cost of the house, the interest rate, and the number of months you will take to repay the bond. It will then calculate and show you the amount you will have to pay each month.

If you type anything other than "investment" or "bond", the calculator will display an error message and ask you to try again.

Please note that all inputs should be numerical values.
